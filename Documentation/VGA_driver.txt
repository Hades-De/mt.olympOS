Overview:
Handles all output to the screen via 80x25 VGA text mode.
Responsible for printing characters, strings, and managing
the screen buffer. Essentially everything visible on screen
goes through this driver.

Registers used:
EAX-> AL, Character incase we want to print a single character,
|---> AH, Color attribute byte
EBX-> String if we want to print a String
EDX-> DL, Control flags
ESI-> Video memory position (you *can* change it outside of this driver, because it just sets it back to where it was each call!)
EDI-> Line counter, As with ESI, You can reset it outside the driver!

Flags:
00000001 - print_char (print one char)
00000010 - loop_func  (loop string)
00000100 - res_scr    (reset pointer)
00001000 - clr_scr    (clear screen)
00010000 - N_line     (new line)
00100000 - start_vga  (init VGA)
01000000 - Unused
10000000 - Unused

Known issues:
Doesnt support variables inside the string, like 'num' into the actual number, (base10 numbers)
Sometimes if the string isn't in the right part of the other driver/application, it cuts it in half
No scrolling

Planned:
Add /n support
fix the half string bug, or make it so that every application has the requirement of putting all the strings at the first part of the data
add the base10 variable print
