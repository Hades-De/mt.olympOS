Mt.OlympOS

Heavily inspired by Terry Davisâ€™s TempleOS, but with my own spin. A from-scratch x86 operating system project.

Current Status

Bootloader: Complete (Stage 1 & 2 working)

Kernel: In progress

Memory handler: In progress (sector map, allocation, freeing routines)

VGA driver: Basic text output implemented

What This Is

Mt.OlympOS is an educational operating system project, written mostly in x86 assembly. The goal is to learn low-level programming, memory management, and system design by building the machine from the ground up.

This is not a recreation of TempleOS. It is a personal project that takes inspiration from its simplicity and directness, while following my own design choices.
